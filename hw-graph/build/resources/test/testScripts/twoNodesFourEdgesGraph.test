# Test that a graph can be created. Two nodes can be added with four edges that there are
# two pairs of edges share the same parents and children but with different labels

# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2

# Add two pairs of edges
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e1
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e2
AddEdge graph1 n2 n1 e3
AddEdge graph1 n2 n1 e4

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1

# Test that a graph can be created and no duplicated edges can be added

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add the same edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)

# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there exist one path between the nodes in an acyclic graph

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in simpleGraph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
C to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000

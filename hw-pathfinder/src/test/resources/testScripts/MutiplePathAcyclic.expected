# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there exist multiple paths between the nodes in an acyclic graph

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph
added node E to simpleGraph

added edge 2.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to D in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to E in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to E in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from D to E in simpleGraph

path from A to E:
A to D with weight 1.000
D to E with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000

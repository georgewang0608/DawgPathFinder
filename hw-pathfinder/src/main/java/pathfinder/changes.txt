Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

I made the two inner class static because that will allow the client to create Node and Edge class without creating
a Graph instance prior to that. For example, if I would like to test the functionality of the Node inner class, then i
no longer needs to create a graph instance just to construct the Node, which makes the code less redundant.

# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there exist two paths between the nodes in an acyclic graph

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 10.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to D in simpleGraph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 10.000
B to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 11.000

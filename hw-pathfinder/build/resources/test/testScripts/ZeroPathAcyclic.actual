# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there does not exist a path between the nodes in an Acyclic graph

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 10.000 from A to C in simpleGraph

path from A to D:
no path found

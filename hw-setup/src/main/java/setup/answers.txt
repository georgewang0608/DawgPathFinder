## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Because for the getFibTerm function in Fibonacci, the condition is set to be n <= 0 when the IllegalArgument Exception
will be thrown. The correct condition should be n < 0 which does not include 0, since 0 is a nonnegative number. The
exception should be thrown when the argument is negative.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The Fibonacci fails the testBaseCase test is because the IllegalArgumentException is thrown for the base case 0. When 0
pass in as the argument, the getFibTerm should accept the argument as it is valid and nonnegative. By changing the if
condition to n < 0, the test will pass noramlly.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The Fibonacci fails because the second if condition of getFibTerm is wrong. When the index is 2, the fibonacci sequence
should be 2 instead of 1. So instead of returning 1 when n = 2, the getFibTerm function should enter the recursive case,
which would return 2. A easy fix is changing n <=2 to n < 2.



## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

The values printed are x:4, y:4, sum:0. The reason is that int x is set to equal to 2*(console.nextInt()/2). Since we
input 5, console.nextInt() will return 5. As 5 is an integer, 5/2 will be 2 and 2*2 = 4. That is why x turns out to be
4 instead of 5. In order to fix it. Simply change the code to x = console.nextInt().

2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)

names and values:
x=3
y=4
current method: computeSum
current line number: 43

3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?
step1:
x=3
y=4
step2:
x=3
y=4
sum=-1
